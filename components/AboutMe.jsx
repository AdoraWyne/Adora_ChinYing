                        Hi there, this is Adora! I&apos;m a software engineer based in Melbourne and recently completed Immersive Software Engineering course from GA. 
                        <br />
                        <br />    
                        Before started my coding journey, I worked as an insurance broker which essentially provides professional service to clients to solve their insurance needs. However, I always feel like I could do more and help more people rather than businesses. My past experience in customer service also taught me to be an empathetic person and consider people&apos;s needs from different angles.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        My experience at General Assembly has given me a taste of the world of Software Engineering. I discovered a new side of me who fall in love in problem solving and crunching codes at nights. 
                        <br />    
                        <br />    
                        It also helps me to gain this powerful & versatile skills to build anything in the virtual world that can impact people in real life, to make people&apos;s lives easier and more convenient. And that makes me happy!
                        <br />    
                        <br /> 
                        I&apos;m looking for an opportunity to be part of a like-minded organisation, with a great team culture, where I can constantly learn and grow. I always love to learn about other people&apos;s journeys. Please send me a message if you are up for a coffee chat! ðŸ˜Š
